Zheng Yang commenced his PhD studies at Central South University (‰∏≠ÂçóÂ§ßÂ≠¶), in September 2022. Currently, he is engaged in research as a joint training PhD student at The University of Melbourne (Â¢®Â∞îÊú¨Â§ßÂ≠¶). He is a guest researcher at Monash University (Ëé´Á∫≥‰ªÄÂ§ßÂ≠¶) and a student member of the Chinese Society for Rock Mechanics and Engineering. He has published **more than 40 papers** in top international journals such as [*International Journal of Rock Mechanics and Mining Sciences*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/international-journal-of-rock-mechanics-and-mining-sciences), [*Rock Mechanics and Rock Engineering*](https://link.springer.com/journal/603), [*Engineering Geology*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/engineering-geology), [*Journal of Rock Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-rock-mechanics-and-geotechnical-engineering), [*Computers and Geotechnics*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/computers-and-geotechnics), with 2 papers selected as **ESI highly cited papers (top 1%)**. His Google Scholar citations have reached 500+, with an H-index of 14. He once received Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China. He has applied for **more than 30 Chinese invention patents** and has been invited to serve as a reviewer for internationally renowned journals such as *International Journal of Rock Mechanics and Mining Sciences*, *Theoretical and Applied Fracture Mechanics*, *Bulletin of Engineering Geology and the Environment*, *International Journal For Numerical Methods in Engineering*, and *International Journal of Damage Mechanics*.

Zheng Yang proposed a novel evaluation index for rock-breaking efficiency, overcoming the bottleneck of traditional indices in accurately identifying fragments. He integrated X-ray diffraction, digital image processing, Newton's Second Law, and Fourier's Law of Heat Conduction to establish a multi-scale, multi-field modeling framework that reproduces the characteristics of real rock masses, aiming to provide more effective solutions for clean energy development. His research interests include deep rock fragmentation, induced seismicity, thermal‚Äìhydraulic‚Äìmechanical‚Äìchemical (THMC) coupling in rock engineering, the development of discrete element method/finite-discrete element method (DEM/FDEM) numerical models, and engineering applications.
